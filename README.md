# No-Name-Game

## Project Overview

This project was developed in response to the specified requirements. The initial timeline for completion was two days; however, due to a delayed notification, the project was finalized within one day.

## Implementation Insights

While all core requirements have been addressed, there are areas where additional enhancements could be beneficial. Suggestions for improvement include:

- **Visual Effects**: Incorporating particle effects and additional animations could enhance the overall user experience.
- **Scoring Mechanism**: Although I considered implementing a more complex scoring system, including penalties for consecutive failures, it was determined that such features might detract from player enjoyment. 
- **Score Streak UI**: The addition of a score streak user interface, complemented by visual effects, could provide positive feedback to players.

## Conclusion

Overall, I am satisfied with the final product. The decisions made during development reflect a balance between meeting requirements and ensuring a positive player experience. I invite your feedback and insights as you review the code and its implementation.
